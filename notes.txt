WEBSOCKETS:

-computer 1 can send info to server and computer 2 can receive the info from the server
-server should be able to host html and js files for sketch

--> writing the server platform: NODE.js (other ways also)
  --> Node is a framework that allows you to:
    1. host files
    2. make socket connections

-EXPRESS: a framework to handle running a server, hosting files, etc.

-PUBLIC FOLDER: files that the user will be able to see.

STEPS:
-create a new folder with a server.js file
-set up npm init: sets up a config file, sets up a package.json files
EXPRESS
-add express: npm install --save express
-import express module to server.js
-create an express application called app
SERVER
-create a server on port 3000
PUBLIC FOLDER
-create a public folder: include files - app.js, index.html
-use app.use to show the public folder
SOCKET
server:
-add socket package in terminal
-import socket module into server.js
-create a function to call a function whenever there is a connection
client:
-add script tag in index.html with socket.io cdn
-in app.js: add a connection function for socket.io
Connecting the client and server:
-client side: send socket.emit with a message name and data
-server side: use socket.on with the message name (from client side) + a callback fn
-client: add function to handle message coming in along with callback function saying what to do with data
